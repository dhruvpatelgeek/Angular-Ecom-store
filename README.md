This is a mean stack E-commerce application made using 
MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).

It mimics how a real E-commerce application would behave:
It has a MongoDB server hosted on a bare metal device and the frontend(angular) interacts with it via REST API via the node.js backend server. It also as authentication(here I have removed it for the ease of demoing) and checkout mechanics.

Further elaborating on the Angular part it has 5 components that communicate to the main:
catlog
cart
nav bar
logo
login
checkout
they communicate with each other using event emitters, observers, and other angular specific methords.
